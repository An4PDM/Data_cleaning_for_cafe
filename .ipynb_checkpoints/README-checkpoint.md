# ☕ *Data Cleaning for Cafe*

This project aims to transform and clean data from a cafe by eliminating redundancies, improving data quality and persistency. It leverages data manipulation techniques using **Pandas**, with a focus on enhancing data integrity and optimizing storage for future analysis.

## 📌 Objectives

- Detect and remove duplicate or inconsistent records
- Convert invalid data types to numeric where applicable
- Replace or handle missing values
- Improve overall data structure and clarity

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and visualization)

## 🧹 Cleaning Steps

1. **Load and inspect raw data**
2. **Detect non-numeric values in numeric columns**
3. **Handle missing values (`NaN`)**
4. **Fix data types and column inconsistencies**
5. **Create a cleaned version of the dataset**

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Data validation and type conversion using `pd.to_numeric()`
- Filtering rows with conditions (`isna()`, `notna()`)
- Creating new DataFrames from cleaned Series
- Good practices in data preprocessing for analysis

## 📁 Output

The final cleaned DataFrame is ready for further use in dashboards, analysis, or machine learning tasks.
